### Hello, I'm SHRUTI JADHAV üëã

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects
- **Project 1**: Optimizing Public Transit Flow and Efficiency
- OVERVIEW:-
- 1) DYNAMIC ROUTE OPTIMIZATION:
Objective: Adjust transit routes in real-time to meet demand and reduce congestion.
Approach:
Use historical and real-time data on traffic, rider demand, and delays.
Implement AI-driven algorithms like genetic algorithms or machine learning models to identify optimal routes dynamically.
Incorporate predictive analytics to adjust routes for major events or disruptions.
Benefits:
Reduced travel time for passengers.
Improved vehicle utilization and reduced fuel/energy costs.
Enhanced adaptability during emergencies or traffic anomalies.
2) CROWD DENSITY PREDICTION:
Objective: Forecast passenger density at specific locations or times to optimize resource allocation.
Approach:
Use IoT devices (e.g., sensors, cameras) to collect data on passenger flow.
Leverage AI and big data analytics to predict crowd patterns based on factors like time, weather, and events.
Implement passenger-facing tools, like mobile apps, to inform users about crowded locations or transit options.
Benefits:
Improved passenger experience by reducing overcrowding.
Smarter deployment of additional transit units (e.g., buses, trains).
Enhanced safety through proactive management of crowding issues.
3) EFFICIENT ACCESSIBILITY MAP GENERATION:
Objective: Create comprehensive maps for passengers to navigate public transit systems efficiently.
Approach:
Use GIS (Geographic Information Systems) to map routes, stations, and facilities.
Include real-time updates for delays, detours, and closures.
Highlight accessibility features for disabled passengers (e.g., elevators, ramps).
Integrate with crowd density data for real-time insights.
Benefits:
Easier navigation for passengers, especially tourists and first-time users.
Improved inclusivity for disabled individuals and other specific needs groups.
Better decision-making for passengers based on real-time conditions.
4) TICKET AND PAYMENT ACCESSIBILITY:
Objective: Simplify fare collection and payment processes to enhance usability and efficiency.
Approach:
Implement digital payment systems like mobile wallets, contactless cards, and QR codes.
Provide diverse fare payment options (e.g., pay-as-you-go, subscriptions).
Use AI-driven pricing models for dynamic fare adjustments based on demand.
Ensure offline payment options for areas with poor connectivity.
Benefits:
Reduced boarding times and improved overall efficiency.
Increased user satisfaction and adoption of public transit.
Streamlined revenue collection and reduced fare evasion.

- 1. Operational Efficiency
Reduced Delays: Dynamic route optimization minimizes delays caused by traffic congestion or unexpected disruptions.
Improved Resource Utilization: Better allocation of vehicles and staff based on crowd density predictions.
Cost Savings: Efficient routes and reduced idle times lead to lower fuel and maintenance costs.
2. Passenger Experience
Reduced Crowding: Predictions and real-time adjustments alleviate overcrowding in vehicles and stations, improving comfort.
Simplified Navigation: Accessibility maps make it easier for passengers, including those with disabilities, to navigate systems confidently.
Convenient Payments: Digital ticketing reduces the hassle of cash handling and long queues, fostering a seamless experience.
3. Environmental Benefits
Lower Emissions: Dynamic routing and optimal resource utilization reduce unnecessary trips, fuel consumption, and CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
Encouraged Transit Use: Efficient and comfortable systems incentivize people to choose public transit over private vehicles, reducing traffic congestion and environmental impact.
4. Economic Growth
Boosted Ridership: A more reliable and user-friendly transit system attracts more passengers, increasing revenue.
Job Creation: Implementing and maintaining advanced systems creates employment opportunities in technology, operations, and analytics.
5. Social Equity
Increased Accessibility: Improved maps and features ensure transit systems are inclusive for all, including disabled and elderly passengers.
Affordability: Dynamic pricing models and diverse ticketing options make transit more affordable for different income groups.
6. Safety and Reliability
Reduced Overcrowding Hazards: Real-time crowd management minimizes risks of accidents or stampedes in busy areas.
Enhanced Trust: Consistent and predictable service builds passenger confidence in the transit system.
Long-Term Implications
Sustainable Urban Development: Optimized transit systems play a crucial role in creating sustainable and smart cities.
Resilience to Disruptions: Adaptable systems are better equipped to handle challenges like natural disasters or sudden surges in demand.
Data-Driven Decision-Making: Continuous collection and analysis of transit data enable long-term planning and innovation.
